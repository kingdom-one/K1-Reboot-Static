# About this Package

[Animate.css](https://animate.style/) is an excellent 3rd-party library, and we **highly recommend** using a [custom build](https://animate.style/#custom-builds) so you can remove bloat.

There are a lot of animations that are, in KJ's opinion, obnoxious. So, you can comment them out, bundle your own version, and create a much smaller, focused css file.
